## About
CSS Playground is my personal repository where I will upload CSS projects for practice and self-learning. It serves as a space for me to experiment and improve my CSS skills at my own pace. Each project presents an opportunity for me to dive deeper into CSS concepts, so, I hope you enjoy seeing the crazy stuff I upload!

## Contributing
As this repository is for personal use, contributions are not expected. However, if you have any suggestions or feedback regarding the projects, feel free to reach out and share your thoughts! :)
